# Air-Quality-prediction

**PREREQUISITE** :
Need to be download these Modules 
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

---

**DETAILS**

* The project is about visualising the dataset and evaluating which model will give the high r2 score for a given dataset
* In this project , C6H6 is used as target feature.since it is of type numerical , Regression models are applied
* The highest r2 score model will be considered as best fit model for a given dataset
* Steps to be followed : 
* importing libraries
* pre-processing : taking info about dataset , removing null values 
* visualization : plotting  different types of graph , finding correlation among dataset
* Splitting the dataset into train and test
* Feature scaling
* Applying Linear ligression, KNN regressor and Decision Tree Regrossor and finding r2 score
